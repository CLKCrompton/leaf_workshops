            <l>5,000 light years from Birdland</l>
            <l>But I'm still preachin' the rhythm</l>
            <l>Long-gone, uptight years from Birdland</l>
            <l>An' I'm still teachin' it with 'em</l>

            <l> Years from the land of the Bird</l>
            <l>An' I am still feelin' the spirit</l>
            <l>5,000 light years from Birdland</l>
            <l>But I know people can hear it</l>

            <l>Bird named it, Bird made it,</l>

            <l>In the middle of that hub</l>
            <l>I remember one jazz club</l>
            <l>Where we went to pat feet</l>
            <l>Down on fifty-secon' street</l>

            <l>Everybody heard that word</l>
            <l>That they named it after Bird</l>

            <l>Where the rhythm swooped and swirled</l>
            <l>The jazz corner of the world</l>

            <l>An' the cats they gigged in there</l>
            <l>Were beyond compare</l>
            <l>Birdland - I'm singin' Birdland</l>
