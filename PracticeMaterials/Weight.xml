            <lg>I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead
            I just need some place where I can lay my head
            "Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
            He just grinned and shook my hand, "no" was all he said</lg>
            
            <lg>Take a load off Fanny
            Take a load for free
            Take a load off Fanny
            And (and, and) you put the load right on me
            (You put the load right on me)</lg>
            
            <lg>I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
            When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
            I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on let's go downtown."
            She said, "I gotta go but my friend can stick around."</lg>

            <lg>Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
            It's just old Luke and Luke's waitin' on the Judgment Day
            "Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
            He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"</lg>
            
            <lg>Take a load off Fanny

            <lg>Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
            He said, "I will fix your rack if you take Jack, my dog."
            I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
            He said, "That's OK, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"</lg>
            
            <lg>Yeah, take a load off Fanny
            Take a load for free

            <lg>Catch a cannon ball now to take me down the line
            My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
            To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
            Who sent me here with her regards for everyone</lg>
