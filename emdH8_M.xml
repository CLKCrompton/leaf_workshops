                  <p>I come no more to make you laugh. Things now

                     <lb type="tln" n="3"/>That bear a weighty and a serious brow;

                     <lb type="tln" n="4"/>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe.

                     <lb type="tln" n="5"/>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,

                     <lb type="tln" n="6"/>We now present. Those that can pity here

                     <lb type="tln" n="7"/>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:

                     <lb type="tln" n="8"/>The subject will deserve it. Such as give

                     <lb type="tln" n="9"/>Their money out of hope they may believe,

                     <lb type="tln" n="10"/>May here find truth, too. Those that come to see

                     <lb type="tln" n="11"/>Only a show or two, and so agree

                     <lb type="tln" n="12"/>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,

                     <lb type="tln" n="13"/>I’ll undertake may see away their shilling

                     <lb type="tln" n="14"/>Richly in two short hours. Only they

                     <lb type="tln" n="15"/>That come to hear a merry, bawdy play,

                     <lb type="tln" n="16"/>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow

                     <lb type="tln" n="17"/>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,

                     <lb type="tln" n="18"/>Will be deceived. For, gentle hearers, know

                     <lb type="tln" n="19"/>To rank our chosen truth with such a show

                     <lb type="tln" n="20"/>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting

                     <lb type="tln" n="21"/>Our own brains and the opinion that we bring

                     <lb type="tln" n="22"/>To make that only true we now intend,

                     <lb type="tln" n="23"/>Will leave us never an understanding friend.

                     <lb type="tln" n="24"/>Therefore, for goodness’ sake, and as you are known

                     <lb type="tln" n="25"/>The first and happiest hearers of the town,

                     <lb type="tln" n="26"/>Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see

                     <lb type="tln" n="27"/>The very persons of our noble story

                     <lb type="tln" n="28"/>As they were living; think you see them great,

                     <lb type="tln" n="29"/>And followed with the general throng and sweat

                     <lb type="tln" n="30"/>Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see

                     <lb type="tln" n="31"/>How soon this mightiness meets misery;

                     <lb type="tln" n="32"/>And if you can be merry then, I’ll say

                     <lb type="tln" n="33"/>A man may weep upon his wedding day.</p>

                        <lb type="tln" n="899"/>I have this day received a traitor’s judgement,

                        <lb type="tln" n="900"/>And by that name must die; yet heaven bear witness,

                        <lb type="tln" n="901"/>And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,

                        <lb type="tln" n="902"/>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful.

                        <lb type="tln" n="903"/>The law I bear no malice for my death.

                        <lb type="tln" n="904"/>’T has done upon the premises but justice.

                        <lb type="tln" n="905"/>But those that sought it I could wish more Christians

                        <lb type="tln" n="906"/>(Be what they will), I heartily forgive ’em.

                        <lb type="tln" n="907"/>Yet let ’em look they glory not in mischief,

                        <lb type="tln" n="909"/>For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em.

                        <lb type="tln" n="910"/>For further life in this world I ne’er hope,

                        <lb type="tln" n="947"/>Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.

                        <lb type="tln" n="948"/>When I came hither I was Lord High Constable

                        <lb type="tln" n="949"/>And Duke of Buckingham: now, poor Edward Bohun.

                        <lb type="tln" n="950"/>Yet I am richer then my base accusers,

                        <lb type="tln" n="951"/>That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it,

                        <lb type="tln" n="952"/>And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for’t.

                        <lb type="tln" n="953"/>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,

                        <lb type="tln" n="954"/>Who first raised head against usurping Richard;

                        <lb type="tln" n="955"/>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,

                        <lb type="tln" n="956"/>Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,

                        <lb type="tln" n="957"/>And without trial fell. God’s peace be with him.

                        <lb type="tln" n="958"/>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying

                        <lb type="tln" n="959"/>My father’s loss, like a most royal prince

                        <lb type="tln" n="960"/>Restored me to my honors; and out of ruins

                        <lb type="tln" n="961"/>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,

                        <lb type="tln" n="962"/>Henry the Eighth, life, honor, name, and all

                        <lb type="tln" n="963"/>That made me happy, at one stroke has taken

                        <lb type="tln" n="964"/>Forever from the world. I had my trial,

                        <lb type="tln" n="965"/>And must needs say a noble one, which makes me

                        <lb type="tln" n="966"/>A little happier than my wretched father.

                        <lb type="tln" n="967"/>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both

                        <lb type="tln" n="968"/>Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;

                        <lb type="tln" n="969"/>A most unnatural and faithless service.

                        <lb type="tln" n="970"/>Heaven has an end in all. Yet you that hear me,

                        <lb type="tln" n="971"/>This from a dying man receive as certain:

                        <lb type="tln" n="972"/>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,

                        <lb type="tln" n="973"/>Be sure you be not loose, for those you make friends

                        <lb type="tln" n="974"/>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive

                        <lb type="tln" n="975"/>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away

                        <lb type="tln" n="976"/>Like water from ye, never found again

                        <lb type="tln" n="977"/>But where they mean to sink ye. All good people

                        <lb type="tln" n="978"/>Pray for me. I must now forsake ye. The last hour

                        <lb type="tln" n="979"/>Of my long weary life is come upon me.

                        <lb type="tln" n="980"/>Farewell, and when you would say something that is sad,

                        <lb type="tln" n="981"/>Speak how I fell.

                        <lb type="tln" n="982"/>I have done, and God forgive me.</p>

                        <lb type="tln" n="1553"/>I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had

                        <lb type="tln" n="1554"/>Commanded nature, that my lady’s womb,

                        <lb type="tln" n="1555"/>If it conceived a male child by me should

                        <lb type="tln" n="1556"/>Do no more offices of life to’t than

                        <lb type="tln" n="1557"/>The grave does to th’ dead. For her male issue

                        <lb type="tln" n="1558"/>Or died where they were made, or shortly after

                        <lb type="tln" n="1559"/>This world had aired them. Hence I took a thought,

                        <lb type="tln" n="1560"/>This was a judgement on me, that my kingdom

                        <lb type="tln" n="1561"/>(Well worthy the best heir o’th’ world), should not

                        <lb type="tln" n="1562"/>Be gladded in’t by me. Then follows that

                        <lb type="tln" n="1563"/>I weighed the danger, which my realms stood in

                        <lb type="tln" n="1564"/>By this my issue’s fail, and that gave to me

                        <lb type="tln" n="1565"/>Many a groaning throw. Thus hulling in

                        <lb type="tln" n="1566"/>The wild sea of my conscience I did steer

                        <lb type="tln" n="1567"/>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are

                        <lb type="tln" n="1568"/>Now present here together: that’s to say

                        <lb type="tln" n="1569"/>I meant to rectify my conscience, which

                        <lb type="tln" n="1570"/>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well

                        <lb type="tln" n="2574"/>To whom he gave these words: "O father Abbot,

                        <lb type="tln" n="2575"/>An old man, broken with the storms of state,

                        <lb type="tln" n="2576"/>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye.

                        <lb type="tln" n="2595"/>(But where he meant to ruin) pitiful.

                        <lb type="tln" n="2596"/>His promises were, as he then was, mighty.
